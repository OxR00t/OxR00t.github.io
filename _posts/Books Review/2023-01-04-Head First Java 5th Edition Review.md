Hello world, Hossam is here, Welcome to my first post of its kind in reviewing technical books. in this post I'll talk about a great book i was reading for a while "Head First Java 5th edition". 

# About the book

Head First Java, 5th Edition is a comprehensive and user-friendly guide to the world of Java programming. Written by `Kathy Sierra`, `Bert Bates`, and `Trisha Gee`.

The book begins with an overview of the fundamental concepts of Java, including variables, classes, objects, and methods. Then it continues on to more complicated subjects like GUI programming, networking, and other things.

There are plenty of examples and diagrams in each chapter to make understanding easier. The author adds numerous practice sections at the end of each chapter to help readers put into practice what they have learned.

# Topics covered in the book

- Java Basics (Variables, conditions, loops, classes...).
- lifecycle of privative types, objects, and garbage collection.
- The interaction between states and methods (Encapsulation).
- Method overloading and Method overriding.
- Inheritance and Interfaces.
- Static methods and states.
- Numbers formatting.
- Data Structures (ArrayLists, HashMap, Sets).
- Sorting objects using comparable interface. 
- Generics, Lambdas, and Streams.
- Exception Handling.
- Swing GUI.
- Serialization and File manipulation.
- communicating using Sockets and Channels.
- Threads and Concurrency issues.
- . . . and mor.

# My opinion

The authors have done an excellent job in making this book accessible to both beginners -like me - and experienced programmers alike. Throughout the book, they have included a lot of helpful hints and tips that can help readers better understand how Java works and how it can be used in different situations.

What I liked most about the book is the easy and creative way to illustrate comparisons in the form of interviews, as shown in the image below.

```
This week’s interview: Instance of an Inner Class 

HeadFirst: What makes inner classes important?

- Inner object: Where do I start? We give you a chance to implement the same interface more than once in a class. Remember, you can’t implement a method more than once in a normal Java class. But using inner classes, each inner class can implement the same interface, so you can have all these different implementations of the very same interface methods.

HeadFirst: Why would you ever want to implement the same method twice?

- Inner object: Let’s revisit GUI event handlers. Think about it...if you want three buttons to each have a different event behavior, then use three inner classes, all implementing ActionListener—which means each class gets to implement its own actionPerformed method.
```

I also like their good use of illustrations, sometimes funny, like the one below

Overall, Head First Java 5th Edition is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn or improve their knowledge of Java programming. It provides a comprehensive overview of the language while also providing plenty of examples and exercises that can help readers gain a better understanding of how it works. Highly recommended!

At the end of this post i wanna thank [Mr. Muhammad Soliman](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lupate) for recommending this great book that's helped me learn java in an organized, funny, and easy way.
